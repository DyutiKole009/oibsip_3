# Personal Portfolio Website
Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Website ! This website serves as an interactive resume and showcase of my projects, skills, and background. Built with a focus on clean design and responsive layout, it highlights who I am and what I do.

## Technologies Used

HTML5 & CSS3 – Structure and styling

JavaScript – Dynamic behavior

Google Apps Script – Backend for contact form

## Sections

Home – Introduction with name, title, photo and other basic social media links

About Me – A quick overview of who I am and my interests

Qualification – Education timeline

Skills – Technical and soft skills

Projects – Highlighting my work

Contact – Form to reach out to me

## Contact Form Integration

This portfolio features a working contact form that submits user messages directly to a Google Sheet using Google Apps Script. No backend or database required.

### How It Works

Form submissions are handled via a simple fetch() call to a deployed Apps Script Web App.

### Benefits

Free and scalable (within Google usage limits)

Fast and serverless

Secure for basic public submissions
